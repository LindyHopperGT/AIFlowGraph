# AIFlowGraph
Flow plug-in for Unreal Engine is a design-agnostic event node editor. It provides a graph editor tailored for scripting flow of events in virtual worlds. It's based on a decade of experience with designing and implementing narrative in video games. All we need here is simplicity.

**AI Flow** plug-in is an extension to the Flow plug-in that adds support for commonly-used AI features like the Environment Query System (EQS) and Blackboards.

See the Flow plug-in documentation for more information.

This is a "Preview" release, requires this version of Flow graph (not yet integrated into the mainline Flow): https://github.com/LindyHopperGT/FlowGraph/tree/5.x
